Replace 'path_to_grid_image.png' with the path to your grid image.


Task 2: Document Scanning
Detects and scans an ID card from an image captured by a camera, applying transformations to provide a scanner-like result.
Replace 'path_to_id_image.jpg' with the path to your image.

Task 3: Human Body Removal from Video
Removes a human body from video frames and tracks its movement. Additionally, it generates a histogram for the first frame and displays the movement path at the end of the video.
